# Python Quiz Project

This is a beginner-friendly Python project that allows users to participate in a short quiz. The program interacts with the user by asking for their name, presents two questions, and provides a score based on their responses. At the end of the quiz, the program offers feedback based on the user's score.

## Features
- Collects the user's name.
- Presents 2 multiple-choice questions.
- Calculates the total score out of 2.
- Provides feedback on the user's performance (based on the score).
  
## How It Works
1. The program starts by asking the user to enter their name.
2. It then presents two questions, each with multiple choices.
3. After answering both questions, the program calculates the score.
4. Based on the user's score, a performance message is displayed (e.g., Excellent, Good, Needs Improvement).
